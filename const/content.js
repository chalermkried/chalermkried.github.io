      Under the technology team, there are many new tools and different service providers that I have learned to use. Also more hands-on experience in product and application building from the bottom to the top.
            
      The works here are pretty broads. I have a lot more opportunities to work in the DevOps part of the product cycle than I had before. My daily tasks as a developer here are less on the Front-end parts. But spread out into many stacks with more focus on the overview of the applications.`,
