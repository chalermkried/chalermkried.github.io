  I like to create and style the websites, make them fast and easy to use as it can be. I care deeply about the UI and UX, how to gain organic traffics for the sites while also try to find the best Developer experience. I'm kind of addicted to problem-solving, or the feeling of solving it, they are always a good challenge to have.
  
  I appreciate and love music, stories, football, and awesome people!`,
